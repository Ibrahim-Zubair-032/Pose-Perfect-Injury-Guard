Pose-Perfect-Injury-Guard
Pose Perfect Injury Guard  is an AI-powered fitness mobile app designed to improve workout form and reduce injury risk during home exercises. It uses pose detection to monitor body posture, provides real-time feedback for correcting exercise form, and estimates the likelihood of potential injuries, ensuring safer and more effective workouts.


 Features

- Pose Detection: Uses AI-based pose detection to analyze exercise form in real time.
- Injury Risk Estimation: Identifies and estimates the likelihood of injury based on body posture.
- Real-time Feedback: Provides instant feedback to help users correct their posture and improve exercise quality.
- Customizable Alerts: Sends notifications to users about possible injury risks, helping them take corrective action to prevent harm.
- Supports Various Exercises: Works with multiple exercises like squats, lunges, planks, and bicep curls, with more to be added.

 Project Components

This repository contains the following files and components:

1. Google Colab Notebooks: Notebooks containing the code for training and evaluation of the pose detection model using machine learning techniques.
2. Pose Detection Model: Pretrained AI model that powers the exercise form evaluation and real-time feedback.
3. Dataset: An annotated dataset of workout videos used for training and evaluating the pose detection model.
4. API Code: Backend code that connects the pose detection model to the mobile app, allowing real-time exercise form analysis.
5. Mobile App: Built using React Native, the mobile app integrates the pose detection model to provide real-time feedback and injury risk estimations during workouts.
